# [0:00:02](https://youtu.be/n65o7bxCnw8?t=2s) Introduction

Overview: The speaker introduces the topic of file I/O and mentions that there are different ways to modify permissions. They suggest referring to a specific file for more details.

## [0:01:17](https://youtu.be/n65o7bxCnw8?t=77s) Reading from a File

- Use the same file descriptor obtained from opening the file
- End of line character and end of file character may differ between Unix and Windows systems, but modern text editors can handle this
- Read chunks of data from the file and write them to the screen in hexadecimal format

## [0:04:49](https://youtu.be/n65o7bxCnw8?t=289s) Copying a File

- Use byte block size or 1024 block sizes to copy from one file to another
- Define a function called `copy_file` that takes two arguments (source and destination files)
- Use read and write functions to copy contents from source to destination

## [0:06:06](https://youtu.be/n65o7bxCnw8?t=366s) Modifying File Descriptor Offset

- Sometimes you may want to start reading or writing at a specific location in the file
- This is useful when dealing with devices rather than text files

Overview: The speaker explains how to use lseek to set the starting byte of a file, and how to start from the end of the file or go back from the current position.

- Use positive values for setting the starting byte.
- Use negative values to go back from the current position.
- There are different ways of using lseek, which are demonstrated in examples.

Overview: The speaker demonstrates an example of creating a large file using lseq without writing anything into it.

- A very big file can be created by putting zeros into its entries.
- This example creates a gigabyte-sized file filled with zeros.
- The operating system is clever enough to understand that it doesn't really use any space on disk since it's composed only of zeros.

## [0:09:26](https://youtu.be/n65o7bxCnw8?t=566s) Example Code for Creating a Large File

Overview: The speaker provides an example code for creating a large file using lseq and writing zeros into it.

- The code reads the filename from the first argument and opens it as read-only.
- It sets an offset and writes zeros into it as much as specified (in megabytes).
- When run, this code creates a huge file filled with zeros.

## [0:12:08](https://youtu.be/n65o7bxCnw8?t=728s) Using Ioctl for Device-Specific Operations

Overview: The speaker explains ioctl, which is device-specific and allows you to do special operations on files if they are devices.

- For each device, the entries and things it can do are different.
- You need to see the corresponding header for that device to know what you can do with ioctl.
- An example is given where ioctl is used to eject a CD from the actual device.

## [0:13:32](https://youtu.be/n65o7bxCnw8?t=812s) Using Files for Inter-Process Communication

Overview: The speaker explains how files can be used for inter-process communication and synchronization between processes.

- One way of synchronizing two processes is by using a file.
- One process opens the file, writes a message into it, and the other process reads the message and does whatever it requires.
- Care must be taken to ensure that messages are not read before they are completely written on the file.

# [0:15:17](https://youtu.be/n65o7bxCnw8?t=917s) Creating a Read Write Lock

Overview: In this section, the speaker explains how to create a read write lock using fctl.

- Use fctl to create a lock sequence for the file.
- One process opens the file and sets the lock.
- If another process tries to read the file, it will be blocked until the lock is released.
- This method helps with synchronization between processes.

# [0:16:12](https://youtu.be/n65o7bxCnw8?t=972s) Synchronization Between Processes

Overview: The speaker continues discussing synchronization between processes and how to use locks to achieve it.

- When running two processes, you don't know which one will gain control of the CPU at what time.
- To synchronize them, you can use locks to ensure that one process completes its task before another starts.
- You can also use locks when sending messages from one process to another by creating a file, locking it, writing the message, releasing the lock, and then allowing the other process to read it.

# [0:17:25](https://youtu.be/n65o7bxCnw8?t=1045s) Break Time

Overview: The speaker asks for a break.
